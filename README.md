# SavjeeCoin

A very simple blockchain implementation to demonstrate the basics of blockchains. This is by no means a complete implementation and it is by no means secure!

In the ``src/`` directory you'll find two versions. Each correspond to a video on YouTube:

* v1: First implementation ([video](https://youtu.be/zVqczFZr124))
* v2: Added proof-of-work mechanism ([video](https://youtu.be/HneatE69814))
